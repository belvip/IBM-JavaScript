# Working with Array Iteration for Restaurant Menu List

## What You Will Learn
In this lab, you will explore how JavaScript dynamically generates restaurant menu sections for **breakfast**, **main course**, and **dessert** using JavaScript's array methods. You will learn to use `map` to populate the breakfast menu, `forEach` to display the main course menu items, and a traditional `for` loop to render the dessert items. Additionally, you will understand how HTML content can be updated dynamically, showcasing the power of JavaScript in modifying webpage elements based on predefined arrays.

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

### Understanding DOM Manipulation
- Gain proficiency in accessing HTML elements and dynamically updating their content using JavaScript.
- Focus on the `getElementById` method to precisely alter specific elements within a webpage.

### Array Iteration Methods
- Differentiate between various array iteration methods like `map`, `forEach`, and `for` loops.
- Observe their distinct functionalities in iterating through arrays and generating structured HTML content.

### Dynamic Web Content Creation
- Learn the process of dynamically generating and rendering content on a webpage.
- Use JavaScript to create structured menus based on predefined arrays, emphasizing the dynamic nature of web development.

### Menu Section Organization
- Grasp the concept of organizing webpage content into sections (e.g., **breakfast**, **main course**, **dessert**).
- Populate HTML elements with data from corresponding JavaScript arrays, facilitating structured and readable webpage layouts.

### Application of JavaScript Methods
- Apply JavaScript methods (`map`, `forEach`, `getElementById`, `innerHTML`) to manipulate an HTML file effectively.
- Showcase the practical usage of these methods in generating and updating webpage content dynamically based on predefined data.

## Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of **HTML**.
- Web browser with a console (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console, and more).
