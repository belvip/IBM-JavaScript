# Develop Followers Count Milestone Alerts Using Functions

## Overview
In this lab, you will create a functional follower counter for an Instagram post and simulate the increase in followers. You will grasp the fundamentals of managing a count variable to simulate a follower count on a social media platform like Instagram. 

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:
- Understand the **basic principles of managing state** (the follower count).
- **Update UI elements dynamically** based on the changing follower count.
- **Trigger actions** based on certain conditions in JavaScript.

## Key Concepts
- **State Management**: Learn how to maintain and update a numerical variable representing the follower count.
- **Event Handling**: Use JavaScript functions to respond to user actions (e.g., button clicks) to simulate an increase in followers.
- **Conditional Alerts**: Implement logic to detect milestone achievements and display alerts accordingly.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.
- Familiarity with **DOM Manipulation** in JavaScript.
- A web browser with developer tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console, etc.).

# Learning Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- **Variables and Incrementation**: Learn how to use variables in JavaScript to store and modify data, specifically to simulate increasing follower counts.

- **Updating Web Content**: Understand how JavaScript interacts with HTML elements to dynamically update content on a webpage, such as displaying follower counts.

- **Conditional Statements**: Explore how to create conditions in code using `if-else` statements to trigger specific actions based on certain criteria, such as displaying congratulatory messages at follower milestones.

- **Function Usage**: Learn how functions in JavaScript are defined and called to perform specific tasks, enabling the control flow of the program and organizing code for better management and reusability.
