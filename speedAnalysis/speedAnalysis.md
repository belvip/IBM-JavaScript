# Create a Text Analysis Tool for Speed Testing Using String Manipulations

## What You Will Learn
In this lab, you will explore:
- Using string methods to create typing test functionality
- Enhancing typing speed and accuracy
- Understanding JavaScript's interaction with HTML elements
- Practicing common phrases and receiving immediate feedback on metrics like words typed and words per minute (WPM)
- Tracking progress and identifying areas for improvement

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

### Implementing a Typing Test Interface
Develop an interactive web interface using HTML and JavaScript.  
Set up:
- Separate text areas for displaying predefined text and capturing user input
- A functional button to initiate and conclude the typing test seamlessly

### Managing Test Execution and Result Display
Establish JavaScript functions to control the test flow:
- Populate predefined text for users to type
- Capture user input and calculate crucial typing metrics (words typed, time elapsed)
- Compute typing speed in words per minute (WPM)

### Providing Immediate Feedback and Analysis
Enable real-time display of essential test results upon test completion, including:
- Number of words typed
- Time taken
- WPM to provide users with immediate feedback on typing performance

### Facilitating Iterative Learning and User Experience
Encourage engagement by:
- Offering a user-friendly platform for practicing typing skills
- Providing a tracking system for progress
- Allowing users to learn from immediate feedback and improve their typing speed and accuracy

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:
- Basic knowledge of HTML and Git commands
- A basic understanding of JavaScript functions and string manipulation methods
- A web browser with a console (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console, etc.)
