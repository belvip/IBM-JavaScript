# Debug a JavaScript Application in Chrome Dev Tools

## What You Will Learn
In this lab, you will gain an understanding of how to debug JavaScript code. You will explore:
- Using `try` and `catch` blocks for error handling
- Identifying issues in JavaScript applications
- Understanding where to use error-handling mechanisms to ensure smooth execution

## Learning Objectives
After completing this lab, you will be able to:

### User Input
- Provide two input fields for users to enter numerical values.

### Operation Execution
- Multiply the two input values when the **"Perform Operation"** button is clicked.

### Error Handling
- Validate user input by checking if the entered values are numbers before performing the multiplication operation.
- If the values are not valid numbers, display an error message instead of the result.

### Debugging
- Use a `debugger` statement within the `multiply()` function to pause execution.
- Allow developers to inspect code, variables, and execution flow using browser Developer Tools.

## Prerequisites
Before starting this lab, you should have:
- Basic knowledge of HTML
- A basic understanding of console debugging and error handling
- Access to a web browser with Developer Tools (Chrome DevTools, Firefox Console, etc.)
